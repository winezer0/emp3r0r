## Motivation

Initially, emp3r0r was developed as one of my weaponizing experiments. It was a learning process for me trying to implement common Linux adversary techniques and some of my original ideas.

**So, what makes emp3r0r different?** First of all, it is the first C2 framework that targets Linux platform including the capability of using any other tools through it. Take a look at the [features](#features) for more valid reasons to use it.

To support third-party modules, emp3r0r has complete [python3 support](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Write-modules-for-emp3r0r#python), included in [`vaccine`](./core/modules/vaccine) module, 15MB in total, with necessary third party packages such as `Impacket`, `Requests` and `MySQL`. emp3r0r also supports `bash`, `powershell`, `python`, `dll`, `so`, and `exe` modules.

Currently, emp3r0r is a single-user C2 framework, but you can leverage the SSH C2-Relay feature if you wish to separate C2 server and operator.

## Features

- Feature-Rich CLI
  - [console](https://github.com/reeflective/console) and [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for CLI infrastructure
  - Auto-completion for commands and arguments, with syntax highlighting
  - Multi-Tasking support provided by [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- Stealth
  - Automatically change `argv` so you won't notice it in `ps` listing
  - Hide files and PIDs via Glibc hijacking (`patcher` in `get_persistence`)
  - [**Bring Your Own Shell**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/blob/master/core/modules/elvish/config.json) such as [`elvish`](https://elv.sh) or any interactive programs via [custom modules such as bettercap](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/blob/master/core/modules/bettercap/config.json)
- All C2 communications made in HTTP2/TLS
  - Defeat [**JA3**](https://github.com/salesforce/ja3) fingerprinting with [**UTLS**](https://github.com/refraction-networking/utls)
  - Painlessly encapsulated in **KCP** fast multiplexed UDP tunnel
  - Able to encapsulate in any external proxies such as [**TOR** and **CDN**s](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/raw/master/img/c2transports.png)
  - [**C2 relaying**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/C2-Relay) via SSH
- Cross-platform memory dumping, dumping mini-dumps from Windows to be compatible with [pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz)
- Staged Payload Delivery for both Linux and Windows
  - [HTTP Listener with AES and compression](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Listener)
  - [**DLL agent**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/DLL-Agent), [**Shellcode agent**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Shellcode-Agent-for-Windows) for Windows targets and [**Shared Library stager with compression and encryption**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Shared-Library-Stager-for-Linux) for Linux
- Automatically bridge agents from internal networks to C2 using **Shadowsocks proxy chain**
  - For semi-isolated networks, where agents can negotiate and form a proxy chain
- Any reachable targets can be (reverse) proxied out via SSH and stealth KCP tunnel
  - [**Bring any targets you can reach to C2**](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Getting-started#bring-agents-to-c2)
  - Useful when targets can't establish outgoing connections but can accept incoming requests
- Multi-Tasking
  - Don't have to wait for any commands to finish
- Module Support
  - Provides [**python3** environment](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/releases/tag/v1.3.10) that can easily run your exploits/tools on any Linux host
  - [Custom Modules](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Write-modules-for-emp3r0r)
  - Supports various modules formats: `exe`, `elf`, `python`, `powershell`, `bash`, `dll`, and `so`
  - Ability to run a module as an interactive shell, eg. `bettercap`, `elvish`.
  - **In-memory** execution for modules: `bash`, `powershell`, `python`, and even ELF executables ([**`CGO` ELF loader**](https://jm33.me/offensive-cgo-an-elf-loader.html))
- Perfect Shell Experience via **SSH with PTY support**
  - Compatible with any SSH client and **available for Windows**
- [Bettercap](https://github.com/bettercap/bettercap)
- Auto persistence via various methods
- [Post-exploitation Tools](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/tree/master/core/modules/vaccine)
  - Nmap, Socat, Ncat, Bettercap, etc
- Credential Harvesting
  - [**OpenSSH password harvester**](https://jm33.me/sshd-injection-and-password-harvesting.html)
- [Process Injection](https://jm33.me/emp3r0r-injection.html)
- [Shellcode Injection](https://jm33.me/process-injection-on-linux.html)
- ELF Patcher for persistence
- Hide processes and files and get persistence via shared library injection
- Networking
  - Port Mapping
    - From C2 side to agent side, and vice versa
    - TCP/UDP both supported
  - Agent Side Socks5 Proxy with UDP support

- LPE Suggest
- System Info Collect
- File Management
  - **Resumable** downloads/uploads with **integrity** verification
  - **Recursive** downloads with **regex filter** support
  - **Transparent `zstd` compression** for data exfiltration
